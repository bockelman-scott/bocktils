Inter Process Communication (IPC)

The word Inter Process Communication itself suggests its meaning, i.e. it is the phenomenon of communicating among different processes. 
IPC in Node.js is how different parts of a Node.js application talk to each other. 
It involves exchanging messages or data between these parts 
to make the application run efficiently, 
taking advantage of Node.jsâ€™ non-blocking and asynchronous design for parallelism.
