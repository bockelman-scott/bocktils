This package contains a set of modules that expose useful utility functions for working with strings, arrays, objects, and functions.

Throughout my career, I have written and rewritten a similar set of small utility functions.
Rather than repeat this process on future projects, I am offering this package as an open-source repository,
free for me or any other developer or company to use in any product or project.
